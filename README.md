### 👋 Hey, I'm Michael (Mike) Perrotte

Creator. Tinkerer. Mentor. Software Engineer.  
**Powered by Coffee.** ☕

I'm passionate about building tools that make developers' lives easier,
contributing to open source, and helping others learn to code. When I'm not
writing code, you'll find me capturing moments through my camera lens,
rock climbing, or playing piano.
